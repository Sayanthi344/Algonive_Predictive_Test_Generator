"# Algonive_Predictive_Test_Generator" 
This is a simple Predictive Text Generator built in Python. The program analyzes a text corpus to learn word patterns and then predicts the next word a user might type based on their previous two words.

This project was completed as part of the Python Programming internship at Algonive.
